# py-csv-escaping

Demonstration on handling backslashes when encoding and parsing CSV files in python 3.

To run:

* Use python 3. The `.python-version` file specifies 3.8.2. I haven't tested other versions, but they may work.
* `python main.py`.
* Observe that the final cell value, "Wonderful Spam", always appears, even if the preceding value has a trailing backslash.
